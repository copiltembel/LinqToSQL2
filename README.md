Linq To SQL2 Net Core
=============
*(this is not maintained anymore - I've switched dev efforts to the [3rd version on NetCore version](https://github.com/copiltembel/Linq2SQL3NetCore))*

This is a port to .NET Core 2.2. Since .NET Core is the future of .NET, maybe this will be useful to someone still using LinqToSQL. See original [Linq To SQL2 project](https://github.com/FransBouma/LinqToSQL2) from where I got the code.

You will need a connectionstrings.json file for the example to work.
